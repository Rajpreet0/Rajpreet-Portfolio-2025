               It depends on your project's scope and needs. If you're interested in a performant, well-designed website, give me a call, and we can discuss a fair, transparent budget for your specific case.

                It also depends on complexity, but as an example:
                   <li className='ml-6'>A landing page with animations and CMS can take around 3 weeks.</li>
                     <li className='ml-6'>A full portfolio or business website with custom components and API integrations may take 4â€“6 weeks including design, development, testing, and deployment.</li>
              </p>
            </AccordionContent>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem value='item-4'>
            <AccordionTrigger>04. Are you available to join full-time?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent className='flex flex-col gap-4 text-balance text-gray-300'>
              <p>
               Yes, I am open to full-time opportunities, provided the conditions are good and aligned with projects that are impactful, innovative, and focused on user value.
